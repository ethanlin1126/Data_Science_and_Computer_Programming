## Final Project - Sleep and Health Data Analysis
Project Overview:<br>
This project utilizes Python to explore correlations between sleep and health data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It features various visualizations, including bar charts, heat maps, and correlation matrices for clarity. Ultimately, models are trained using Linear Regression and Logistic Regression to predict different data aspects.
